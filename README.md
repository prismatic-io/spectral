This monorepo contains packages to build custom Prismatic connectors and code-native integrations using TypeScript.

## Building Locally

You will need `yarn` and `node` installed.
Run `yarn turbo run build` to build and `yarn turbo run test` to run the test suites. `yarn pack` and `yarn link` are both useful for testing changes locally.
